# Mobile-application-Development


1. Description of the Project
Overview: The mobile application for enterprise management of shift schedules. Managers create shifts, and employees can view the schedule, set availability, and request swaps.
Target Audience: From small to medium businesses that have to work with employees who operate on shifts.
Goal: To make scheduling easier with fewer errors, and improve communication.
2. Problem Being Addressed
Conflicts: No overlapping schedules because availability is made clear.
Availability: Employees set when they're free so managers know whom to schedule.
Notifications: Notifications about schedule changes keep employees up-to-date.
Shift Swapping: Workers can swap shifts amongst themselves by communicating with each other and having the manager approve it.
3. Platform
Mobile: iOS and Android Apps for on-the-go access to scheduling.
Web Dashboard: Managers schedule their staff on the desktop.
4. Front/Back-End Support
Front-End:
Mobile: done on React Native - iOS, Android.
Web: also done on React.js for easy usage on computer devices.
Back-End:
Node.js to handle data.
Firebase for storing all schedules and user data hence allowing login.
